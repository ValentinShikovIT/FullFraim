## Features - MVC

> ### Landing page (visible to everyone)
```sh
> The landing page displays the top, ranked highest photos. 
> If you are not part of our society yet, you have the possibility to register and then login and start participating.
> Upon registration you will be asked to confirm your credientials by accepting the confirmation email.
```
> ### Dashboard page (visible only to logged users)
FOR ORGANIZERS
```sh
> They can create new contests.
> They can view in which phase a contest is (open, in reviewing, finished)
> Then can view all photo junkies registered on the website.
```
FOR PHOTO JUNKIES
```sh
> They can view Open contests in which they can participate.
> They can view the contests that they participate in.
> They can view their current score and how much points are required to reach the next rank.
```
> ### Contest page (visible only to logged users)
FOR CONTESTS IN PHASE ONE
```sh
> You have the ability to view the remaining time until the contest reaches Phase Two.
> "JURY" can view the submitted photos but cannot rate them yet.
> You will see the "Enroll" button if you are not currently enrolled to participate in the current contest
> To participate, you will need to fill
-- Title for the image (short text)
-- Story for the image (long text)
-- Photo with which to participate (be careful of the contest category)
> A user can only submit one photo per contest.
> Once a photo is submitted, it cannot be edited
```
FOR CONTESTS IN PHASE TWO
```sh
> You have the ability to view the remaining time until the contest reaches "Finished" Phase.
> Participants cannot upload anymore, therefore the "Enroll" button is no longer active.
> "JURY" sees a form for each submitted photo
-- Score (1-10)
-- Comment (long text)
-- Checkbox to mark that the photo does not fit the contest category (If it doesn t)
> "JURY" can only give one review per photo
```
FOR CONTESTS IN FINISHED PHASE
```sh
> "JURY" can no longer review photos.
> Participants view their score and comments.
> In this phase, participants can also view the photos submitted by other users, along with their socres and comments by the jury.
```
> ### Create contest Form (visible only to Organizers or above)
```sh
-- Title (text field)
-- Category
-- Open or Invitational
-- Time Span of Phase One
-- Time Span of Phase Two
-- Select Jury (all Organizers are automatically selected as a jury)
-- Cover Photo for the Contest (with three options 1. upload 2. with URL 3. Select from previous)
```
> ### Scoring (Implementation)
```sh
> Joining an open contest - 1 points
> Being invited by organizer – 3 points
> 3rd place – 20 points (10 points if shared 3rd)
> 2nd place – 35 points (25 points if shared 2nd)
> 1st place – 50 points (40 points if shared 1st)
> Finishing at 1st place with double the score of the 2nd (e.g., 1st has been awarded 8.6
points average, and 2nd is 4.3 or less) – 75 points
> In case of a tie, positions are shared, so there can be more than one participant at 1st, 2nd,
and 3rd places, all in the same contest.
> For example, two 1st places, one 2nd and four 3rds; the two winners will each get 40 points, the
only 2nd place will get the full 35 points, and the four 3rd finishers will get 10 points.
```
> ### Ranking (Implementation)
```sh
> (0-50) points – Junkie
> (51 – 150) points – Enthusiast
> (151 – 1000) points – Master (can now be invited as jury)
> (1001 – infinity) points – Wise and Benevolent Photo Dictator (can still be jury)
```
